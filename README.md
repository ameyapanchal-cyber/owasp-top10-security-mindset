# OWASP Top 10 – Security Mindset

This repository documents my theoretical understanding of the OWASP Top 10
web application security risks with a focus on attacker thinking,
threat modeling, and vulnerability assessment methodology.

This repo is intentionally theory-based and serves as a foundation
before starting hands-on exploitation labs.

Topics covered:
- OWASP Top 10 overview
- Attacker mindset
- Developer assumptions
- Threat modeling
- Vulnerability assessment thinking
